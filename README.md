**Description**
Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) is a distributed message queuing service introduced by Amazon.com in late 2004. It supports programmatic sending of messages via web service applications as a way to communicate over the Internet. SQS is intended to provide a highly-scalable hosted message queue that resolves issues arising from the common producer-consumer problemor [BS1] connectivity between producer and consumer
 
Amazon SQS automatically deletes messages that have been in a queue for more than maximum message retention period. The default message retention period is 4 days. However, you can set the message retention period to a value from 60 seconds to 1,209,600 seconds (14 days) using the SetQueueAttributes action
